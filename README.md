Bank Database using SQL

In this SQL Project, I have created a Bank Database System using the SQL Queries for managing, updating and for the retrieval of bank transaction data.

Used the concepts of Joins, Primary Key and Foreign Key for the implementation of Database in MySQL

This Database System thoroughly manages the data and also stores data efficiently.
